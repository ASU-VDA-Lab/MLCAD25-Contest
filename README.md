# **ReSynthAI: Physical-Aware Logic Resynthesis for Timing Optimization Using AI**


Join the exciting MLCAD 2025 Contest and showcase your innovative skills in combining artificial intelligence with electronic design automation (EDA). This year's challenge, **ReSynthAI**, focuses on Physical-Aware Logic Resynthesis aimed at timing optimization.

## Contest Overview

Participants are tasked with leveraging AI techniques, including supervised, unsupervised, and reinforcement learning, to perform logic resynthesis. The challenge emphasizes the importance of physical awareness, ensuring that decisions made post-logic synthesis improve the post-global route quality of results as shown in the figure below.

The transformations at the netlist level include gate sizing, buffer insertion, Vt swaps, gate cloning, and combinational logic restructuring.

### Please find the contest description [*here*](https://github.com/ASU-VDA-Lab/MLCAD25-Contest-Scripts-Benchmarks/blob/main/MLCAD2025-Contest-Problem-Statement.pdf).

## Contest Challenges Include:

- Applying machine learning techniques (supervised, unsupervised, reinforcement learning) for logic resynthesis.
- Ensuring physical awareness in resynthesis and ensuring routability without congestion overflows.
- Demonstrating timing improvements post global route by performing netlist optimizations post logic synthesis. 


## Updates:
We have extended the alpha submission deadline to June 15th.
